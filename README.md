# Simple Implementation of the Viterbi Algorithm for training Hidden Markov Models.
This is an implementation of the Viterbi Algorithm for training Hidden Markov models. This repo accompanies the video found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqSzLo9fenk

This implementation can handle prior probabilities, and any sized probability transition matrix. It cannot handle exit probabilities though.

## Example sets

Choose any one of the function names in the example_sets class file and use it like so in the __main__:

example_sets.function_name()
